<h1>More Results, Closer Matches in Tests Now: But Will That Be Enough to Save Cricket’s 5-Day Format?</h1>

About the project: Test cricket seems to be replete with such tight finishes nowadays, and it led me to wonder, has men’s Test cricket become more exciting in recent years?

Findings: Even as Test cricket grapples with an existential crisis, an analysis of match results data reveals that the sport's longest format is a tighter contest now than it has been in a century.

Data collection process: I used BeautifulSoup to scrape pages from <a href="https://meghnadbose.github.io/data-stories/test_cricket.html](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/list-of-match-results-by-year-307847" target="_blank">ESPNCricinfo's</a> list of Test match results. There was one page for each year from 1877 to 2023, and so I scraped more than 140 pages. I then analysed the match results data.

Overview of the data analysis process: The first question facing me was - how do we determine or compare how exciting Test matches are over a period? I did this using two factors.

<ul><li>Firstly, are more Test matches ending with decisive results instead of draws? Granted that some close draws can be thrilling to watch, but we wouldn’t want every other five-day encounter ending with no winner, right? Our first factor is, therefore, the percentage of draws in Test matches played over a given time period.</li>

<li>Secondly, how close were the matches? Did the team batting last win by one wicket or nine? Or did the team that bowled last win by 10 runs or 200? Typically, the smaller the margin of victory, the more exciting a match has been. Therefore, our second factor will be the margin of victory.</li></ul>
